# Dash-n-Cash
## Inspiration

I thought this would be a cool app to encourage people to walk more and drive less as it offers rewards and punishes you for using your car for your trips.

## What it does

This program can calculate the amount of money you saved by walking to your location or it calculates the amount of mondey you spent on gas and subtracts that from your score. With every trip you take, you can accumulate money (or lose it!) and see how high you can get your score.

## How I built it

Since I am very new to coding, I used python to run a loop calculating the score for multiple "trips" that the user took. Since I was familiar with R through my science courses, I also used R to extract the fuel efficiency from a very large dataset of models and fuel efficiencies. 

## Challenges I ran into

Since I am a beginner, one of my challenges was just being too ambitious with my code at first. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud that I got as far as I did since I was only here to have fun and learn as much as possible.

## What I learned

I learned how to make this simple code as well as used my previous R knowledge to extract data from an excel file and use it to calculate the amount saved or spent by a user depending on their car.

## What's next for Dash n' Cash

Ultimately, my vision was to have this like a gaming app on your phone where you compete with your friends to see how high your points can get. Integrating a Fitbit or Apple Watch step tracking capabilities would be goal so you are not inputting that information manually. I am also hoping to have an API that can retrieve current gas prices from your local gas stations so it is up to date on how much you are "spending" or "saving" and use that rather than asking for that input. Finally, I understand it is not ALWAYS feasible to walk so it can be cool to have a feature where it only subtracts if you took the car for trips less than a certain amount of km.
